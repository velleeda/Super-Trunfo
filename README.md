# Super Trunfo

A small card game created during **Alura**'s **Immersion.Dev**; <br />

The game consists of drawing a random card and choosing 1 (one) attribute among 3 (three), being them attack, defense and magic, after choosing the attribute just click on the **Play** button, the game will check if your attribute is greater than the machine attribute, if it is greater you **win** and earn 1 (one) point, if they are equal, there is a **tie** and no one receives points, if it is lower you **lose** and the machine earns 1 (one) point. **Win** whoever has the most points when the cards run out; <br />

The game was created to serve as **learning**, using basic javascript fundamentals.
